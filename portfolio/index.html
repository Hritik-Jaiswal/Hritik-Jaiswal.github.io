                <p class="intro-subtitle">Hello, I am a student with passion for programing and coding. which is why I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science.

                    I am currently in 2nd year of BCA and I am learning things like backend development, java, python, UX design, apps development.
                    
                    I first got into IT as a teenager while in school, and helped other students who were having problems with their phones or laptops. I also love how this allowed me to build on my skills, and soon I became 'the go-to guy' for helping other students fix any technical issues they had..

                    I am a hardworking and enthusiastic individual who is looking for an internship . I am proficient with Visual Studio Code, Adobe XD and Adobe Illustrator. I would be delighted to learn the workings of your team and gain experience in the field of Information and Technology.

            <h1>My plans for upcoming future as a coder.</h1>
            <p>
                In the future, I want to be a programmer. When I say "future", I am not referring to the distant future, but rather the near future. I know that programming skills are in high demand now and will only become more valuable as time goes on. The best way to prepare myself is by learning how to code now. I want to become a programmer because I like to create things and solve problems. Programming is a unique skill that allows me to design, build, and maintain software. I am passionate about coding and technology and plan on continuing to grow my knowledge in this area. I hope one day to be a full stack developer, knowing both front-end and back-end code.  I plan to continue learning frontend development as I feel as though it is my true passion. I will be seeking to learn more about web development, and how it can be used to solve problems creatively. I have always been fascinated with technology and the various ways in which it can be used to improve lives. Over time, I have come to realize that I am also passionate about app development, and so I am making plans to begin studying programming and coding this coming semester and to see what I can do with it. Python is a versatile programming language that can be used to create desktop & web applications, video games and many other things. I enjoy learning about coding and have been looking for ways I can improve my skills. My goal for the next few months is to complete the Python Track on Code Academy and read some books on Python programming. I have always been interested in games, and I've created a few simple games on my own. I'm currently in the process of learning to code on Unreal, but am not sure what the next step should be.
